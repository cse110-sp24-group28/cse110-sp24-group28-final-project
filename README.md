After cloning the repository, please install npm
https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm#using-a-node-version-manager-to-install-nodejs-and-npm

Then, run npm i to install packages

If you want prettier to format on save, you also need to configure your ide to run it

for vscode, install the prettier extension: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode

for webstorm, go to preferences and enable format on save

in order to run the application, just run the command ```npm run dev``` rather than
use live server (to keep things consistent between team members)
